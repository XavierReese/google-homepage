# google-homepage

This is my first true project in The Odin Project.  It is January 16, 2019.  This is me creating the google homepage (aesthetically) using my skills in using DevTools, HTML, and CSS.  I also am trying my first true full project with GitHub.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
